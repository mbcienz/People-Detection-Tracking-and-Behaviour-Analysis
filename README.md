# People-Detection-Tracking-and-Behaviour-Analysis
This project, part of the Artificial Vision Contest 2025, aims to develop an advanced system for automatic video analysis. The proposed software will detect and track all people in real-time within a video; recognize pedestrian attributes, namely, gender, bags and hats; analyze behaviors by monitoring virtual line crossings.
